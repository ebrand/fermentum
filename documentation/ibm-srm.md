IBU & SRM
  IBU (International Bitterness Units)

  What it measures: The bitterness level in beer from hops

  Scale:
  - 0-20 IBU: Very low bitterness (wheat beers, some lagers)
  - 20-40 IBU: Low to moderate (pilsners, pale ales)
  - 40-60 IBU: Moderate to high (IPAs, ESBs)
  - 60-80 IBU: High (American IPAs, barleywines)
  - 80+ IBU: Very high (double IPAs, imperial stouts)

  Examples:
  - Bud Light: ~7 IBU
  - Guinness: ~45 IBU
  - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale: ~38 IBU
  - Dogfish Head 90 Minute IPA: ~90 IBU

  Technical: IBU measures alpha acid compounds (from hops) that create bitter taste. Human palate typically can't distinguish above ~100 IBU.

  SRM (Standard Reference Method)

  What it measures: Beer color intensity

  Scale:
  - 1-3 SRM: Very pale (light lagers, wheat beers)
  - 3-6 SRM: Pale (pilsners, pale ales)
  - 6-12 SRM: Gold to amber (oktoberfests, ESBs)
  - 12-20 SRM: Amber to brown (brown ales, porters)
  - 20-35 SRM: Brown to dark brown (stouts)
  - 35+ SRM: Very dark/black (imperial stouts)

  Examples:
  - Budweiser: ~2 SRM (pale straw)
  - Sam Adams Boston Lager: ~11 SRM (amber)
  - Newcastle Brown Ale: ~17 SRM (brown)
  - Guinness: ~30 SRM (dark brown/black)

  Technical: SRM measures light absorption through beer. Determined by malt types - darker malts (roasted, caramel) increase SRM.

  Why Brewers Track These

  Recipe Development:
  - Target specific style guidelines
  - Balance bitterness with malt sweetness
  - Achieve desired appearance

  Quality Control:
  - Consistency between batches
  - Meeting customer expectations
  - Competition judging standards

  Example Recipe Targets:
  American IPA:
  - IBU: 40-70
  - SRM: 6-14
  - Creates hoppy, golden beer

  Irish Stout:
  - IBU: 25-45
  - SRM: 25-40
  - Creates balanced, dark beer

  In brewing software like Fermentum, these values are calculated automatically based on:
  - IBU: Hop varieties, quantities, boil times, alpha acid content
  - SRM: Malt types, quantities, color ratings (Lovibond)

  This helps brewers predict final beer characteristics before brewing.
